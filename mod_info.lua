description = "This is a Unit pack created using the 4th Dimension 2.12 mod, Future updates will hope to add some more of the cool features attempted in the Mod. New iteration fixed some issues regarding Overcharge (Hopefully), full list of changes can be found in the changelog file. This does not contain the balance changes that the 4th Dimension mod added. Works with FAF. This pack was written by OptimusPrime81 and several others, all credit for units and various subsystems created go to them, I merely adapted it for use with FAF. If bugs are encountered, please take screenshots and send the steps to recreate it to: the4thdimensionfaf@outlook.ie"
